mission:
  description: >-
    The Shohola Scholarship Foundation has a dual mission. We seek to aid boys
    in making camp a reality each year while building a larger fund whose
    interest will support future children.


    Each year, Shohola receives dozens of applications from parents who want to
    give a summer of growth and learning to their children, but cannot afford to
    do so.


    With your help, we will make the stuff of dreams a reality.

    The Shohola Scholarship Foundation is a not-for-profit, 501(c)(3),
    corporation. The money raised through your charity goes directly to support
    tuition for boys at Camp Shohola. The foundation pays a deeply discounted
    tuition for each child, thus assuring that all funds donated benefit the
    child in need.


    The foundation's director is Frank "Kit" Barger, now retired director of
    Camp Shohola. Now that Kit has turned the keys to camp over to his son
    Duncan, his primary focus, is to share the joy and the dream of Camp Shohola
    with those that may not otherwise be able to attend.
