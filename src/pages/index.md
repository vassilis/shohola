    The Shohola Scholarship Foundation is a not-for-profit, 501(c)(3),
    corporation. The money raised through your charity goes directly to support
    tuition for boys at Camp Shohola. The foundation pays a deeply discounted
    tuition for each child, thus assuring that all funds donated benefit the
    child in need.


    The foundation's director is Frank "Kit" Barger, now retired director of
    Camp Shohola. Now that Kit has turned the keys to camp over to his son
    Duncan, his primary focus, is to share the joy and the dream of Camp Shohola
    with those that may not otherwise be able to attend.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
