title: Ways to Give
---

Here are the ways you can give so that we can continue to support deserving kids who otherwise would not be able to have their lives affected in the positive way that we did at Shohola:

**[Network For Good](https://myshohola.networkforgood.com/)**  
One time, monthly, quarterly or annual recurring donations Via "Network for Good" - the easiest way to give online.

**[Amazon Smile](www.smile.amazon.com)**  
Did you know that everyone of your purchases on Amazon can benefit the Shohola Scholarship Fund? Here is how:

1. Sign on to amazon with: [www.smile.amazon.com](www.smile.amazon.com)
2. From the "Charity List" search for Camp Shohola Scholarship Fund and select us.
3. Every purchase you make when signing into Amazon via smile.amazon will spin off at no extra cost to you a little bit to the fund.
4. Have a business that uses Amazon - consider utilizing this for your business as well!

**Facebook Birthday Fundraisers**  
You have likely seen them - Facebook will walk you right through it. Last year one alumni was able to raise over \$3000 via the Facebook fundraising program.
