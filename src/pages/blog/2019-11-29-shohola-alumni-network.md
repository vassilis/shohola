The Alumni Association Professional Network enhances the value of being a Shohola alumnus. Our aim is to link, mentor and support each other, long after our summers on Greeley Lake have gone by. Many former counselors vouch to how valuable their counselor years were in shaping them for their futures and that is something we want to leverage now for the benefit of Camp.

The influence of Camp on our professional life starts in Working Seniors and progresses through the JCIT, CIT and counselor years, with valuable leadership and life skills acquired along the way (this includes, of course, putting up with other’s smelly feet!). Camp benefits from having former camper’s experience and spirit back year after year. The Professional Network will support this with a handful of actions that increase the value for counselors of staying into their college years and beyond. Through the Network, counselors in high school will be able to receive guidance on career choices and college applications. Afterwards, they will be able to use the Network to gain professional experience through internships, shadowing, and mentorship.

Beyond the counselor years, we want to establish a network that can also be used by all to enhance and help us in our careers- that lifelong Apache Race that is much more fun when accompanied and cheered-on by others. In the coming months, the Professional Network will be reaching out to receive testimonies about the lifelong value of camp and to request information about you and your career.
